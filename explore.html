            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate an energy called Cursed Energy,[Jp. 1] which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Normal people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses,[Jp. 2] a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters.</p>

After an infamous demon kills his whole household with the exception of his younger sister Nezuko (who was turned into a demon instead), Tanjiro sets out on a quest to restore Nezuko’s humanity and protect the other dear friends he meets along the way. The bond between these siblings is so powerful that they’re even able to bring a terrifying spider demon to his knees—someone they should’ve had no hope of even scratching. It really inspires you to look out for your own family!</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">A strange turn of events leads the Dragon, Tohru, to work as Miss Kobayashi's maid. She occasionally (that's a lie, she often) causes trouble for her beloved Miss Kobayashi while blending into human society and splendidly (that's a lie, only mediocrely) carrying out her maid duties. Her fellow dragons, Kanna, Lucoa, Fafnir, and Elma all find their own places to fit in as well and enjoy interspecies interactions with the humans. Yet while they're all enjoying that laid-back and occasionally turbulent left, the threat of a new Dragon swoops down upon Miss Kobayashi.</p>

However, as a fight quickly breaks out between the Yorozuya and the Tenshouin Naraku, suspicion grows, forcing Gintoki to use what is nearest—a loincloth—to mask his identity. Saved for the time being, Gintoki enters the Yorozuya office, but unbeknownst to him, someone else is already waiting there...

After boarding the Gorilla Amanto mother ship, he realizes that he doesn't speak their language. Confused, Kondou tries conversing with them, only to inadvertently gain their support.

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Terrorism isn't anything good, that isn't something to debate. Nonetheless, it has become one of the most prevalent tragedies of the last few decades. Released back in 2014, Terror in Resonance explores the tragic undertones of a monumental issue in modern history with striking imagery and plot mechanics.</p>

            <a href="https://youtu.be/4vPeTSRd580" target="_blank"><img src="pic\grave.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="One Piece"/></a>
            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Sometimes, the older films of the past generation offer even more of a worthwhile plot than modern classics. At least, the Studio Ghibli film, Grave of the Fireflies, certainly does. Released all the way back in 1988, the story follows the wartime stories of Seita and his sister Setsuko.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Very few incidents can follow with as much heartbreak as a natural disaster. Separating families, these massive tragedies can destroy thousands to millions of lives without warning. These are just a few of the themes displayed in the tragic tale of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Crime stories have become very popular in recent years. Among the many thoughts, many fans of this genre think "What could have been done differently?"; Erased looks to answer this question. Focused on the story of Satou Fujinuma, he receives the ability to go eighteen years in the past to prevent mysterious crimes committed against his family and friends.</p>

            <a href="https://youtu.be/vk6mg74R5Ek" target="_blank"><img src="pic\plastic.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="One Piece"/></a>
            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">The evolution of robotics is a common trope in both sci-fi movies and anime alike. However, only a few series touch on the sadder parts of this topic. That said, Plastic Memories does focus on these critical issues, as audiences follow the journey of Tsukasa Mizugaki and the android Isla.</p>

            <a href="https://youtu.be/nfK6UgLra7g" target="_blank"><img src="pic\slient.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="One Piece"/></a>
            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Anime films (many of which are available on Netflix) have the potential to be even more saddening than their episodic counterparts. The movie A Silent Voice is a perfect example of this, hitting audiences with its alluring, down-to-life plotline. Telling the story of Shoya Ishida and his deaf classmate, Shoko Nishimiya.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Everybody loves a good mystery, anime or not. Able to build suspense and hide tragic events, the audience often comes to unexpected conclusions; this is most definitely the case for the 2016 series, Orange.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Among the many titles in the genre, Clannad has become something of a classic. For old-timers, the series offers a nostalgic feeling. For newcomers, it offers a dramatic series with world-shattering undertones. Focused on the story of Tomoya Okazaki, follow as the new high-schooler explores his skewed view of happiness and reality.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Some series are built to hit the viewer right in the feels. I Want To Eat Your Pancreas (contrary to what the title alludes to) builds a world that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking to its very core. The story focuses on the story of a girl, named Sakura, who suffers from a rare, fatal pancreatic illness.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Key visual novels have become known for their heart-wrenching storylines (and romantic subplots), as well as their excellent visuals. Angel Beats, the anime released in 2010, has a legacy for many as being one of the most compelling of these. Taking viewers to a school-time afterlife, the story revolves around Otonashi Yuzuru and a band of renegade teenagers fighting against passing on.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">There's just something amazing about watching passionate, creative people practice their craft, and Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken taps into that same feeling by focusing on three high school girls who create anime together. Asakusa is the socially awkward artist who envisions elaborate fantasy worlds based on small observations in her daily life, Mizusaki is a famous model whose passion for animating human movement affects every aspect of her being, and Kanamori is the no-nonsense producer whose love of organization and cold hard cash keeps the other two on track to finish their projects. The sheer amount of love and creativity on display, both from the girls and the studio that created the show, is enough to inspire anyone to try a new craft!</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">If you could go back to high school, what would you do differently? Recently unemployed 27-year-old Kaizaki Arata enters an experimental trial to change his appearance to that of a 17-year-old and go back to high school for one year. He thinks it’ll be a breeze since he has more life experience, but he instantly flunks his tests and struggles with the new policies that have cropped up in schools in the intervening years. Humbled, he devotes himself to learning from the experience and getting to know his classmates on a deeper level. What follows is a story of conquering regrets and pursuing meaningful relationships that really inspires you to take life by the horns and be who you want to be. Even if you hate how your life has transpired so far, today is the day for you to change that!</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Science is awesome! That's the main driving force behind Dr. Stone, a shounen anime that eschews hype battles in favor of speedrunning the history of human progress with a combination of Stone Age materials and good old ingenuity. Mangaka Inagaki and artist Boichi have both committed countless hours of research to ensure that each invention Senku and his team create is as realistic as possible, drawing up elaborate road maps that explain how they can make antibiotics, cell phones, and more in a world devoid of modern conveniences. We genuinely believe that this show will encourage many of its young readers to enter STEM fields in the future—what crazy new inventions will they dream up with Dr. Stone as their inspiration?</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Even though he's a world-class figure skater, Yuuri's belief in himself had plummeted through the floorboards ever since he suffered a devastating loss at the Grand Prix Final one year ago. But then, his idol Victor floated into his life and pulled him out of his dark depression by becoming his coach with the goal of winning the next Grand Prix Final. As they train, travel, and go to competitions together, Yuuri and Victor realize that their mutual admiration has transformed into love before their very eyes.

                This was one of the first mainstream anime to feature a homosexual relationship between its main characters, and certainly the first to be so open and supportive of a healthy, loving bond between two men. Yuri on Ice was and continues to be a vitally important show for LGBT youth, as well as anyone who needs that extra bit of motivation to get out of a dark place in their life. We’re so happy that it exists!

Luckily, we have How Heavy are the Dumbbells You Lift to whip us into shape with the power of cute anime girls! Hibiki, Akemi, and the other girls of Silverman Gym learn new exercises (which are actually accurate and very well explained), get up to entertaining antics, and constantly make fourth-wall-breaking jokes that reference other anime. It’s a simple show that panders to typical anime fans for the express purpose of inspiring them to go to the gym, but we’ll be darned if doesn’t work!</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Shigeo (better known as Mob, due to his generic looks and shy personality) is possibly the strongest psychic in the world, but keeps his powers and feelings bottled up because he’s afraid that he could hurt someone. Even so, he strives to improve himself through means that he can control, such as joining the Body Improvement Club and helping his mentor Reigen solve supernatural mysteries. Mob grows into such a confident young man over the course of the series that we feel like proud parents who have cheered him on throughout his countless struggles. If Mob can find his place in the world, then so can you!

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">Tanjiro Kamado has the exact kind of drive to get stronger and determination to succeed that you’d expect from a shounen hero, but he does it all to protect his family. After an infamous demon kills his whole household with the exception of his younger sister Nezuko (who was turned into a demon instead), Tanjiro sets out on a quest to restore Nezuko’s humanity and protect the other dear friends he meets along the way. The bond between these siblings is so powerful that they’re even able to bring a terrifying spider demon to his knees—someone they should’ve had no hope of even scratching. It really inspires you to look out for your own family!</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">In a future where AI music rules the record industry, shy guitarist Tuesday and long-suffering keyboard player Carole don’t seem like they stand a chance at reaching anyone with their songs. But after they bond over an impromptu jam session on a bridge, the two decide to enter a worldwide music competition and show the complacent public what real music really sounds like. Their story, as well as the glimpses of other characters’ lives that we see throughout the competition, feel like a more wholesome version of the manufactured character arcs from real world talent shows like American Idol or the Eurovision Song Contest. If you’ve ever wanted to pursue a creative dream, Carole & Tuesday encourages you to make it come true with your own two hands!</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">When you need some good old sports anime motivation in your life, Run with the Wind has you covered. The Kansei University track and field team is made up of a ragtag bunch of misfits led by Haiji, a talented runner who dreams of taking the team to the Hakone Ekiden relay race and reclaiming his glory after an injury in high school almost ended his career. Each character comes from a difficult background and has a lot to prove on the track, but by working together and slowly becoming a true team, they all manage to tackle their struggles and accomplish something that they can be proud of. No matter where you are in life, Run with the Wind shows that if you have friends and a goal to work toward, you can get through anything.

            <p style="font-size: x-large;color:white;">This peppy magical girl romp is all about following your dreams and becoming the best version of yourself. Our protagonist Haruko has made it her mission in life to become a princess—not necessarily a literal one, but the kind of girl who is strong, kind, and beautiful at heart—so that she can one day reunite with the only person who believed in her dream many years ago and show him all that she’s accomplished. Haruko diligently works to help people, such as when she studied the violin so that she could save a brainwashed girl by jogging her memory of the violin duet that she and her brother used to play together as children. If Haruko and her team can become princesses, then you can become anything you want!
